      <p><b><i>4-4-2020</i></b>-As almost the whole world is stuck in quarintine and almost everyone is bored out of their minds we have decided to make a few open source projects. At the time of writing this we are currently working as hard as we can to get a good website out for you. We do not have a good idea of what we will be working on next but we are still in the process of changin the "Raid The Romans" social studies project into <a href="">Processing Java<a> game instead of a lot buggier <a href="">Python Processing<a> to finish that project. Right now we do not have any idea of what we will be doing after we finish these two tasks but feel free to sugest something in the google form bellow. </p>
